# smoothfs support matrix

The smoothfs stack has three independently-versioned moving parts — the kernel module, the Samba VFS module, and the tierd control plane — plus the four lower filesystems we test against. This page pins the combinations SmoothNAS ships **tested**; anything outside this set may work but has no support commitment.

Last reviewed against Phase 7.10 (Phase 0–7 complete; Phase 8 gated on production soak).

## Appliance OS

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Base OS | Debian 13 (trixie) |
| Libc | glibc 2.41 |
| Init | systemd ≥ 255 |
| Package format | `.deb` via apt |

Older Debian releases (12 / bookworm) are not supported because the kernel floor (§Kernel) excludes them.

## Kernel

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Minimum | **6.18.0 LTS** |
| Tested | 6.18.22-smoothnas-lts, 6.19.10+deb13-amd64 (Debian bpo) |
| DKMS floor | enforced by `BUILD_EXCLUSIVE_KERNEL="^(6\.(1[8-9]|[2-9][0-9])|[7-9]\.).*"` in `dkms.conf` |
| Why 6.18 | smoothfs uses `lookup_one`, `set_default_d_op`, the dentry-returning `vfs_mkdir`, the new `renamedata` shape, `vfs_mmap`, and the parent-inode + qstr `d_revalidate` signature — all of which landed by 6.18 |

Kernel version below 6.18 → DKMS silently skips building smoothfs for that kernel (Phase 7.3 test `kernel_upgrade.sh` verifies this). The appliance still boots; smoothfs pools won't mount.

## OpenZFS

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | **2.4.1** |
| Source | upstream OpenZFS built via SmoothKernel recipes (Phase 2.3), **not** Debian's `zfs-dkms` |
| Why | Debian's `zfs-dkms 2.3.2` caps at kernel 6.14 — incompatible with our 6.18 floor. OpenZFS 2.4.1 is the first upstream release that builds against 6.18+. |

Mixing Debian's zfs-dkms with smoothfs-dkms on the same host is **unsupported** — the DKMS autoinstall for zfs will fail silently on every kernel upgrade.

## Samba

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version | **2:4.22.8+dfsg-0+deb13u1** (Debian 13 stock) |
| Vendor suffix | `Debian-4.22.8+dfsg-0+deb13u1` |
| VFS ABI pin | `smoothfs-samba-vfs` deb has `Depends: samba (= <exact version>)`; SmoothNAS also writes `/etc/apt/preferences.d/smoothnas-samba-vfs` whenever `smoothfs.so` is present |
| Rebuild trigger | any Samba security update; unattended upgrades blacklist Samba packages so the VFS module is never bypassed automatically |

The `smoothfs-samba-vfs` package rebuilds itself at dpkg-buildpackage time against the installed Samba source tree (via `apt-get source samba=<version>`). The SmoothNAS release workflow requires `smoothfs-protocol-gate.yml` to pass before stable releases, and that gate runs the Linux NFS/SMB protocol tests plus the mixed-protocol soak on a self-hosted SmoothFS runner. Windows SMB soak support is shipped as `scripts/smoothfs-windows-smb-soak.ps1` and runs when a Windows SmoothFS protocol runner is configured.

## Pool lower filesystems (per-tier backing)

A smoothfs pool is a stack over N tier targets; each target is a lower filesystem.

| Lower | Status | Phase validated | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `xfs` | **Supported** | Phase 1 (bare minimum), Phase 3 functional validation | Primary production choice — reflink, robust under write-amplification, used by Phase 5 SMB + Phase 6 iSCSI harnesses. Requires ≥ 300 MB per tier for mkfs. |
| `ext4` | **Supported** | Phase 3 | Fully functional; slower reflink than XFS. |
| `btrfs` | **Supported** | Phase 3 (+ explicit reflink / subvolume coverage) | Reflink via `FICLONERANGE` tested; snapshot-on-the-lower works. |
| `zfs` | **Supported** | Phase 1 / 2 baseline | Whole-dataset tier target; pool UUID must match. |
| `bcachefs` | Not supported | — | Phase 3 capability gate would accept it if proven; nothing has driven that validation yet. |

Other filesystems (fat / ntfs-3g / overlayfs / fuse / etc.) are not capability-gate-accepted and smoothfs will refuse to mount over them (returns `EOPNOTSUPP` with a `dmesg` line).

## Protocols

| Protocol | Status | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| **NFS v3 / v4.2** | Supported | 4.0–4.5 (cthon04 clean, connectable filehandles) |
| **SMB 2/3** | Supported | 5.0–5.8.4 (smbtorture 16/16 MUST_PASS, Samba VFS module with lease pin + FileId + fanotify lease-break) |
| **iSCSI (file-backed LUN)** | Supported | 6.0–6.5 (O_DIRECT conformance, LIO fileio round-trip, `PIN_LUN` contract, target restart) |
| Active-LUN movement | **Unsupported in v1** | Phase 8 (gated on Phase 6 soak) |

LUN backing files are auto-pinned with `PIN_LUN` and tierd refuses to move them. Operators who need to move a LUN must quiesce the target, clear the pin manually, move, re-pin. The automated active-LUN path is Phase 8.

NFS server tuning is automatic on boot and before NFS service enablement. SmoothNAS writes nfsd/mountd/statd/lockd port config, opens the matching firewall ports, raises the nfsd max block target to 2 MiB, and raises the client sunrpc TCP slot table for SmoothNAS-initiated mounts. Linux clients may still negotiate 1 MiB `rsize/wsize`; that is a client/kernel limit outside the SmoothNAS export configuration.

## Secure Boot

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| MOK provisioning | Per-appliance; DKMS auto-generates `/var/lib/dkms/mok.{key,pub}` on first install |
| Enrollment helper | `/usr/share/smoothfs-dkms/enroll-signing-cert.sh` wraps `mokutil --import` |
| Regression gate | `/usr/share/smoothfs-dkms/module_signing.sh` asserts PKCS#7 signature + DKMS signer |
| Production single-key path | Not in v1 — each appliance enrolls its own key; a future "single offline-managed signing key across the fleet" story would let one cert trust modules built on any build host |

## Packaging

| Package | Version | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `smoothfs-dkms` | 0.1.0-1 | `RakuenSoftware/smoothfs` `src/smoothfs/debian/` — Phase 7.0 |
| `smoothfs-samba-vfs` | 0.1.0-1 | `RakuenSoftware/smoothfs` `src/smoothfs/samba-vfs/debian/` — Phase 7.1; rebuilds against installed Samba |
| `tierd` | 0.1.0-1 | `tierd/debian/` — Phase 7.4; ships `/usr/sbin/tierd` + `/usr/bin/tierd-cli` + systemd unit |

The three debs are independently versioned but expected to move together in a SmoothNAS release.
